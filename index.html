                        <p>Graphic design is the craft of planning and creating visual content to communicate ideas and messages. Graphic design is everywhere you look in digital age — from billboards to cereal boxes to mobile apps.
                        Through incorporating different elements and principles, these designs can influence our perception and emotions. Graphic design is also known as a communication design, and Graphic Designers are essentially
                        visual communicators. They bring visual concepts to life, most commonly through graphic design software, and inform or engage consumers through text, graphics and images. graphic design is one way that companies
                        connect with consumers. Design can be used to promote and sell products, to convey a message, or to develop a brand identity. Though some graphic design has a commerical purpose, Graphic Designers combine art
                           and buisness, so the creative process is informed in part by buisness goals.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0"> The reason why Graphic design colors are important is because using color in graphic design to create contrast is powerful for three main reasons: Color contrast attracts the eye because it creates Visual interest. Conflicting colors look like glaring errors, while complementary colors are subtle yet clear to the subconscious mind.</p>

                                <p>Lines are arguably the most important element because they’re the building blocks of your composition and can be used to add style and structure, divide space, or draw attention to the most important aspects of a design.</p>

They can also influence consumer behavior. Shapes can be used to symbolize ideas or concepts, set a mood or emotion, create a travel path for the eye around the design, create depth or movement, and connect content and imagery in a layout.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0">Size is an important aspect of graphic design because it can convey importance, attract attention and create contrast. It is responsible for creating a visual hierarchy among elements of your creation. It tells viewers which elements to look at, in what order to look at them, and what's most important to focus on.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0">Space is an important element in graphic design. It is used to separate or connect elements in your design layout. Adding wide space creates emphasis on the difference between different graphic elements of the composition and by adding more narrower space between them creates more relationships between the elements.</p>

                <h2><u>Part A</u></h2>
                <h4> How did animate.css changed Graphic design in the past?</h4>
                <p>Animate.css changed Graphic Design in the Past beacuse the website has been used by many designers and devolepers to create engaging and interactive websites. Which means that people realize that not only they can draw online but they can be able to animate there drawings which leads them to make a animation online. Which means they are able to make a animation with their drawings that they created.</p>
                <h2><u>Part B</u></h2>
                <h4> How will Graphic design might change in the future?</h4>
                <p>Graphic design will play a significant role in creating immersive and interactive experiences for users through augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D printing. Graphic design will also use material design, a design language developed by Google, to mimic real-world items and optimize on-screen touch experiences.
                As technology continues to progress, designers will have more expressive ways of sharing their vision. Augmented reality and virtual reality experiences allow people to get inside the experience whether it’s for recreational, educational or occupational purposes.
                Future changes in graphic design really depend on the technologies that support graphic design creatives and the technologies where graphic design is applied and realized into physical communications materials. </p>
